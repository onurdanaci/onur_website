## Job Experience

- **2023–2025 — Postdoctoral Researcher — Leiden University (Own Grant)**
_NWO Quantum Delta Initiative – MaZelTof-Q project_

• Developed digital twins for superconducting quantum devices using physics-aware neural
networks.
• Automated tune-up and calibration using deep RL and Bayesian optimization.
• Addressed flux crosstalk calibration via AI-driven methods.

- **2021–2023 — Postdoctoral Research Fellow — Leiden University**
_Applied Quantum Algorithms Center_

• Led projects regarding quantum advantage demonstrations on real hardware.
• Designed GPU-based quantum simulators using JAX.
• Designed and implemented a reinforcement learning-based optimization algorithm to improve
performance of variational quantum circuits under hardware-induced noise, improving con-
vergence and robustness in simulation benchmarks.
• Led projects in Hamiltonian & non-Markovian noise learning.

- **2021 — IBM-HBCU Quantum Center Research Fellow — Howard University, University of Illinois Chicago**
  
• Worked on quantum optimal control and tomography with IBM Quantum hardware.
• Developed a quantum game based on Fock state interactions in coupled waveguide systems.
• Designed a volume-law entangled quantum optical system based on the spatial geometry of
a cavity, and specific placements of qubits inside this cavity.
• Simulated the classical modes within these quantum optical cavities using FDTD methods.
Combined these classical results with full quantum modeling via Green’s dyad formalism.
• Applied surrogate modeling and RL for photonic structure optimization.

- **2014–2020 — Graduate Research Assistant — Tulane University**
  
• Designed ML and numerical methods to model the generation, propagation and control of
spatial modes of quantum light for quantum information processing in non-linear optical
systems. In particular generation multi-mode squeezed coherent states, and their propagation 
under atmospheric turbulence & other obstructions.

- **2019 — Data Science Intern — Jackson Laboratory**
  
• Optimized demultiplexing software (libraries in C++. R, Python) for single-cell omics data (mRNA-Seq) using Bayesian ML. 
Used deep convolutional neural networks to classify bioinformatic data. This internship brought me upto speed both in modern
practices of data science & machine learning engineering, and bio-statistics/bio-informatics.

- **2011–2013 — Graduate Research Assistant — Koc University**
• Modeled quantum optical and plasmonic systems using numerical tools (Qutip & Lumeruical FDTD) and Green’s dyad
formalism (to fully model quantum dynamics using classical mode solutions).
